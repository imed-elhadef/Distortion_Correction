Graphical Distortion Correction

The main role of this code is to implement graphical distortion correction transformation with following parameters:

*Input data comes from ideal fish-eye lens with 180 degree field of view.
*Input frame is rectangular with a valid area circular image inside rectangle


Since, I am working the majority of my time with Linux System, I tested the code with my ubuntu 14.04.

I have already created a script which help the user to compile openCV 2.4.9 library from scratch in ubuntu 14.04 system, the name of the script is "openCV-install" (I have uploaded the script in this repositry).

Also, I have created a Makefile to compile my c++ code.

You have just to make these instructions:

install the "openCV-install" script
cd Distortion_correction ## Move to my folder Distortion_correction
make ##Compile the C++ program
./correction  ##Execute the program
